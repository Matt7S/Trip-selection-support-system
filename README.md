# Trip-selection-support-system
Group project on the subject of decision support systems.

# Overall description
This project aims to address a specific problem by implementing various decision-making methods and creating a user-friendly graphical interface. The project encompasses the following tasks:

- **Problem Selection:** Identifying and defining the problem to be addressed.
- **GUI Creation:** Developing an intuitive graphical user interface for user interaction.
- **Database Creation:** Setting up a database system to store and manage relevant data.
- **Final Conclusions:** Summarizing the project findings and outcomes.
- **Report Editing:** Editing the project report for clarity and coherence.

Additionally, the project involves algorithm implementations and comparisons:

- **Topsis Method:** Implementing the Topsis method to generate rankings and select compromise solutions, considering both discrete and continuous cases.
- **SP-CS Method:** Implementing the SP-CS method for ranking construction problems.
- **Reference Set Method (RSM):** Implementing the RSM method for selecting compromise solutions and creating rankings.
- **Ideal Point Achievement:** Implementing the method from Chapter 7 of [1] or an alternative approach as approved by the supervisor.
- **Ranking Comparison:** Comparing rankings generated by different methods.
- **Method Comparison:** Evaluating and comparing the performance of various decision-making methods.

The entire team will collaborate on creating a PowerPoint presentation summarizing the project's results.
